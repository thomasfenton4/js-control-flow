# JavaScript Foundations: Control Flow Practice

This repository provides practice problems to help users strengthen their understanding of JavaScript control flow. The challenges focus on implementing functionalities related to products and their properties.

## Problem Statement

Inside the `src/solution.js` file, you will encounter functions that deal with product-related operations. Each product is an object that follows this structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "Slip Dress",
  priceInCents: 8800,
  availableSizes: [0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16]
}
```

Your task is to modify these functions based on the provided instructions to achieve the desired functionality.

## Instructions

1. **checkSize Function**: Update this function to return if a particular size is available using a ternary operator. 
2. **newYorkCitySalesPrice Function**: Determine the tax applied based on the city and calculate the total price. Use a `switch` statement for this purpose.
